## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned about how the CSS justify-content: space-between works, as well as the transparency property in HSLA colors.

```css
.box {
  border-radius: 10px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  padding: 17px;
  margin: 0 0 15px;
}

.reaction {
  background: hsla(0, 100%, 67%, 0.05);
  color: hsl(0, 100%, 67%);
}
```

### Continued development

I will be studying and practicing CSS media queries in order to improve my mobile design skills. Also, I will be reading the documentation of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to understand more about CSS justify-content and media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning.
- [CSS Gradient](https://cssgradient.io/) - This is an amazing page in which you can create your own gradient background with CSS.
- [CSS matic](https://www.cssmatic.com/) - This helped me create a shadow for the results summary card.
